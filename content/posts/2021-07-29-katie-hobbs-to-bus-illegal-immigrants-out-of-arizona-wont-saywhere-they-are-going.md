    Katie Hobbs to bus illegal immigrants out of Arizona, won’t say
    where they are going
  description: |-
    “We’re interested in focusing on the humanitarian aspects of this
    and just putting people on a bus as a political stunt and sending
    them to Martha’s Vineyard or wherever they went is not providing
    any help or any solution to the actual issue.”
