    helps - study

    BEIJING (Reuters) -Antibodies triggered by Sinovac Biotech's COVID-19
    vaccine declined below a key threshold from around six months after a second
    dose for most recipients, but a third shot had a strong booster effect, a
    lab study showed.  Chinese researchers reported the findings from a study of
    blood samples from healthy adults aged between 18-59 in a paper published on
    Sunday, which has not been peer reviewed.  Among participants who received
    two doses, two or four weeks apart, only 16.9% and 35.2% respectively still
    had neutralising antibodies above what researchers regard as a detectable
    threshold level six months after the second shot, the paper said.
