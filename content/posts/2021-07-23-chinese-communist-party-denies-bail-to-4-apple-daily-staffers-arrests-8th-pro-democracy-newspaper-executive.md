  title: Chinese Communist Party denies bail to 4 Apple Daily staffers, arrests
    8th pro-democracy newspaper executive
  description: On June 24, Hong Kong police raided the headquarters of Apple Daily
    and froze all major assets, forcing the news service to shut down its
    business and publishing. Ever since, any remnant of Jimmy Lai has been
    forcibly destroyed in order for CCP to remain in complete control.
